Load.c //A writer
========
Create a shared memory segment to store the students' records ;
Create a shared memory segment to store the shared variable read_count;
Create a semaphore set consisting of enough semaphores (actually 2 will do);
Attach the two shared memory segments created;

Wait(semaset, 0); // assuming semaset is the id of the semaphore set created
Initialize read_count to 0 (the shared memory allocated for storing this var);
Load the shared memory segment with data from the file;
Signal(semaset, 0);
---------------------

Change.c //A writer
========
Get the id of the shared memory segments created for storing data;
Attach the shared memory segments;
Get the id of the semaphore set created;

Prompt the user for password;
Validate the password // just check if the user types 000;

Prompt and get information from the user.

Wait(semaset, 0)// assuming semaset is the id of the semaphore set 

  ..update/delete/..
  ....

sleep(2) // for debugging and testing
Signal(semaset, 0);
-------------------------------
Query.c  // A reader
=======
Get the ids of the two shared memory segments created in Load.c;
Attach the shared memory segments; 
Get the id of the semaphore set created in Load.c;
Get the id of the student the user wants to query;
Wait(semaset,1);
increment read_count; // in shared memory
if value of read_count==1 then Wait(semaset, 0);
Signal(seamset,1);



search the shared memory for the record of the student with the
id, the user typed;
if found print the results to the screen;
if not print "record not found" to the screen;

sleep(2) // for debugging and testing

Wait(semaset,1);
deccrement read_count; // in shared memory
if value of read_count==0 then Signal(semaset, 0);
Signal(seamset,1);
----------------



Print.c
=======
similar to Query.c  // A reader

-------------------------
Clean.c  // A writer
=======
Get the ids of the two shared memory segments created;
Attach the shared memory segments;
Get the id of the semaphore set created in Load.c;
Prompt the user for password;
Validate password;// just check if the user types 000;

Wait(semaset, 0)// assuming semaset is the id of the semaphore set 
write the contents of the shared memory to file in the format of the input file;
delete the shared memory segments
Signal(semaset, 0);

delete the semaphores.
